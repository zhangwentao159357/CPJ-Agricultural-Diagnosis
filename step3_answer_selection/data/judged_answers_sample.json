This chlorotic pattern is indicative of early-stage infection. Upon closer inspection, fine white fungal growth can be seen on the underside of the leaf near the discolored areas. These are the sporangia of Peronospora tabacina, the causal agent of tobacco downy mildew. If left untreated, the disease is likely to spread rapidly under cool, moist conditions, causing widespread leaf blighting and reduced photosynthesis. Other leaves on the plant should be examined for similar symptoms to assess the extent of the infection.

If caused by an underlying disease or pest problem, symptoms could potentially spread to other leaves and parts of the plant over time under favorable conditions for the pathogen or insect.\n\nOther Observations: The leaf appears relatively small in size compared to typical mature leaves, suggesting it may be a young or newly emerged leaf. There are no visible signs of physical damage, wilting, curling, or other deformities that would indicate mechanical injury or severe stress.\n\nTo provide a more accurate diagnosis, higher resolution images showing multiple leaves and different parts of the plant, as well as information on growing conditions, recent weather patterns, and any history of previous issues would be necessary.",

This isolated spot suggests initial infection. Under favorable conditions (cool, moist weather), scab can rapidly spread, causing numerous lesions to develop, coalesce, and lead to premature defoliation and reduced fruit quality.
