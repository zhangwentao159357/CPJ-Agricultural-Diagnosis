        "question": "What measures can be taken to control Rice Blast?",
        "answer": "(1) Select 2-3 locally resistant varieties, such as Zao 58, Xiangzaoxian 3, 21, 22, 86-44, 87-156, Wandao 61, Ganzhao 39, 42, 41, Boyouzan 19, Zhongyouzao 81, Zhusi 2, Peiliangyou 288, Huaxianzhan, and Shanyou 77 for early rice. For mid-season rice: Qidaozhan 1, Qixiuzhan 3, Peizashanqing, Sanpeizhan 1, Dianyinlujing 1, Ningjing 17, Ningnuo 4, Yangfuxian 2, Shengyou 2, Yangdao 2, 4, Dongxun 101, Dongnong 419, Qiyou 7, Jia 45, Xiushui 1067, Wandao 28, 32, 34, 36, 59, Shanyou 89, Teyou 689, Shanyou 397, Shanyouduoxi 1, Mancang 515, Quannong 3, Jinyou 63, Shanyouduoxi 1. For late rice: Xiushui 644, Yuanjing 4, Jin 308, Jingdaoxuan 1, Jijin 15, Huajing 45, Liao 244, Shen 9017, Gangyou 22, Bijing 37, Dianzhajing 2, Gangyou 2, Dianxian 13, 14, 40, Ningjing 15, 16. For drought-resistant varieties, choose Lin 3, Lin 5, Jing 31119, China 91. For dry direct seeding, use Zhengzhou Early Jing, Zhonghua 8.\n(2) Use disease-free fields for seed collection, treat infected straw, and eliminate pathogen sources. Use soil disinfectants.\n(3) Seed treatment: Soak seeds in 56℃ hot water for 5 minutes. Use 10% 401 antibacterial agent 1000 times solution or 80% 402 antibacterial agent (pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics) 2000 times solution, or 70% methyl thiophanate 1000 times solution for 2 days. Alternatively, use 1% lime water for 6 days at 10-15℃, or 1-2 days at 20-25℃, with lime water 15cm above the seeds. Let stand, rinse 3-4 times with clean water. Soak seeds in 2% formalin for 20-30 minutes, then cover with a film for 3 hours.\n(4) Use disease-free fields for seed collection, treat infected straw, and eliminate pathogen sources. Use soil disinfectants.\n(5) Strengthen fertilizer and water management. Scientific management of fertilizer and water can improve environmental conditions, control pathogen reproduction and infection, promote healthy rice growth, and enhance disease resistance for stable and high yields. Apply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in balance, combining base fertilizer, organic fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer, with appropriate use of silicon fertilizers (e.g., plant ash, slag, kiln ash potassium fertilizer). Apply sufficient potassium fertilizer, early topdressing, and appropriate mid-term fertilization based on crop and field conditions. Mixed application of silicon and magnesium fertilizers can significantly reduce disease incidence. Apply appropriate amounts of green manure, lime to promote decomposition, and neutralize acidity. In cold immersion fields, increase phosphate fertilizer application.\n(6) Rotate fungicides due to the unique resistance of rice blast pathogen. Common fungicides like Jinggangmycin, Chunlei mycin, tricyclazole, methyl thiophanate, blastil, and Fuji No.1 should be alternated. For prevention and early disease: spray diluted 800-1200 times. For mid to late disease: spray diluted 800-1000 times. For severe cases: spray 20% tricyclazole 500 times solution, followed by specific fungicides like Menshen 800 times solution after 7 days. Use tebuconazole for leaf blast in early to mid-July, applying 25% fluopicolide-tebuconazole 0.75-0.9L/ha or 45% tebuconazole 0.42-0.5L/ha, spraying twice weekly. For neck blast, spray at the beginning and full heading stages. Use the same dosage as for leaf blast.",

        "answer": "Leaf Blast: Can occur throughout the growth period, with severe damage during the tillering to jointing stages. The disease presents four types of lesions based on climate and variety resistance. Chronic lesions start as dark green spots, expanding into spindle-shaped lesions with brown necrotic lines. The center is grey-white with brown edges and a yellow halo. Grey mold develops on the lesion's back, forming irregular large lesions. Acute lesions appear as dark green, near-circular or elliptical spots on susceptible varieties, with brown mold on both leaf surfaces. Under unfavorable conditions, they turn into chronic lesions. White spot lesions form small, white, near-circular spots on susceptible young leaves, which do not produce spores but can develop into acute lesions under favorable conditions. Brown spot lesions form tiny brown spots between leaf veins, mostly on highly resistant varieties or old leaves, with minimal spore production. Node Blast: Occurs post-heading, starting as brown dots on the nodes, gradually expanding around the node, turning it black and brittle. Early infections cause white heads. Neck Blast: Begins as brown dots on the neck, spreading and browning the neck, causing white heads. Late infections result in unfilled grains. Infected panicle branches or rachis lead to sterile spikelets. Grain Blast: Forms brown elliptical or irregular spots, blackening the grains. Some hulls show no symptoms, while the glumes turn brown, carrying the pathogen. Leaf Blast: Initial stages involve small, dark green lesions on the leaves.",

Rinse seeds thoroughly with clean water and air-dry before sowing.\n3. **Crop Rotation**: Rotate tomatoes with cucurbits or other solanaceous vegetables every three years to reduce soil-borne pathogens.\n4. **Greenhouse Disinfection**: In greenhouses where rotation is difficult, disinfect before planting by burning a mixture of 0.25 kg sulfur powder and 0.50 kg sawdust per 37 m³ of space, sealing the greenhouse for 24 hours. Alternatively, use 45% chlorothalonil smoke fumigant at 0.25 kg per 110 m² for one day.\n5. **Cultivation Management**: Manage temperature and humidity in the greenhouse, ventilate appropriately, control watering, and reduce humidity after watering. During prolonged rainy periods and post-infection, limit irrigation. Use appropriate plant density, prune to enhance ventilation and light penetration, and apply balanced fertilizers, avoiding excess nitrogen. Increase phosphorus and potassium. Remove infected leaves promptly and dispose of them by deep burying or burning.\n6. **High-Temperature Treatment**: On sunny days, close the greenhouse at noon to raise the temperature to 30-33°C for about 2 hours, then ventilate to lower the temperature.

It belongs to the kingdom Fungi, subkingdom Basidiomycota, class Urediniomycetes, family Puccinaceae, genus Puccinia. Summer spores are unicellular, spherical to nearly spherical, yellow-brown, finely spiked with 6-8 scattered germination pores, measuring 18-29×17-22 (μm); winter spores are bicellular, rod-shaped, with a flat top and a short dark brown stem, measuring 39-57×15-18 (μm). Winter spores germinate to produce four small spores, infecting alternate hosts, resulting in the formation of rust bodies and sex organs. The sex organs are orange-yellow, spherical to flattened spherical, measuring 80-145μm, embedded under the host epidermis, producing orange-yellow oval sexual spores. Rust bodies form on the corresponding backside of leaf lesions, capable of producing chain-like spherical rust spores, measuring 16-26×16-20 (μm). To differentiate from wheat stripe rust, take a small amount of summer spores, add a drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid, cover with a glass slide, and inspect under a microscope; stripe rust spores will concentrate into multiple small clusters, while leaf rust concentrates into a single central cluster.",

        "answer": "The pathogen overwinters as mycelium, conidiophores (plates), or ascocarps in fallen diseased leaves. In the following spring, conidia are produced after rain and spread to the tree by wind and rain, infecting leaves and causing lesions. Circular spot disease occurs earlier, with onset in late April to early May in northern China, reaching its peak 2-3 weeks later. Brown spot and grey spot diseases generally occur simultaneously in May-June, peaking in July-August, with severe damage in the fall. The diseases thrive in hot, rainy conditions and are more severe in poorly managed orchards with dense canopies and weak trees. Varieties like Guoguang, Hongyu, Qingxiangjiao, and Jinguo are more susceptible, but their resistance to the three diseases varies.",

        "answer": "1. Cultivating Healthy Seedlings: Preventing early infection is crucial. Remove weeds around the nursery bed and disinfect the soil to reduce pathogen sources. Use TYLCV-resistant B root irrigation agent (3000x dilution) and cover with 40-60 mesh insect-proof netting. Spray TYLCV vaccine every 5 days starting from the 2-3 leaf stage, for three applications. Use TYLCV-resistant B (2000x dilution) for root irrigation during transplanting and pre-planting.\n2. Agricultural Practices: At planting, water with TYLCV-resistant B (2000-3000x dilution). After seedling establishment, spray TYLCV-resistant A (1 packet per bucket of water) every 3-4 days, for four applications. Control nitrogen fertilizer and maintain soil moisture. Apply fertilizer and water in small, frequent amounts to avoid drought and waterlogging. Ventilate to prevent high temperatures and regulate field temperature and humidity. Apply organic fertilizer to promote robust plant growth and enhance disease resistance. Spray TYLCV-resistant agent once or twice during the first and second fruit clusters. Remove weeds and plant debris to reduce insect sources. Use 40-60 mesh insect-proof netting at greenhouse vents and yellow sticky traps to prevent whitefly.\n3. Treatment: If infection occurs, irrigate with TYLCV-resistant B (2000-3000x dilution) and spray TYLCV-resistant A or TYLCV vaccine every 3-4 days for 4-5 applications. Alternatively, apply TYLCV-resistant B as a drench (1000-1500 ml per acre). During treatment, avoid using growth regulators or general virus drugs. The best time for treatment is 3-4 days after watering. Two treatments can control the spread, and 3-4 treatments can restore early infected plants. For advanced infections, combine root irrigation and spraying for rapid recovery.\n\nEfficacy of Treatment:\n1. Three vaccinations during the seedling stage can achieve over 90% disease resistance.\n2. Combined treatment with seedling vaccination, root irrigation, and four sprays of TYLCV-resistant agent after transplanting can achieve over 96% disease resistance.\n3. Additional spraying during the first and second fruit clusters can achieve over 99% disease resistance.\n\nImportant Considerations for Treatment:\n1. Root irrigation is more effective than drenching. Use 500 ml of root irrigation agent for 2000-2500 plants, mixing 6-7 ml with 30 kg of water for 30 plants. For drenching, use 2-3 bottles per acre.\n2. Spray TYLCV-resistant agent or vaccine during cooler parts of the day (morning or evening) for best results. Dilute the solution twice for uniform application. Use 30-45 kg of water per acre before flowering, 45-60 kg during flowering, 60-75 kg during the first and second fruit clusters, and 120-150 kg for more than three clusters. Mix one packet of agent with 30 kg of water. Adding agricultural silicone adjuvants enhances effectiveness.\n3. Reasons for treatment failure: (a) Mixing or alternating with hormone-containing foliar fertilizers or general antiviral agents, or using excessive hormone concentrations during flowering; (b) Insufficient dosage or uneven spraying; (c) Not adhering to the treatment schedule.\n4. Effective treatment of TYLCV depends on correct application methods and dosages. Insufficient or uneven application will not yield satisfactory results.",

        "question": "Could you provide information about the pathogen responsible for Pumpkin Powdery Mildew and its distinct disease characteristics?",
        "answer": "The pathogen belongs to the Oidium genus within the subphylum Eumycotina. In Southern China, the fungus spreads through asexual conidia, which act as the primary and secondary inoculants, relying on air currents to transfer between host crops in the field, completing the disease cycle without a clear overwintering phase. The fungus often produces sexual chasmothecia (appearing as tiny black specks within the powdery substance) towards the end of the growing season for surviving the summer or winter. However, in southern regions like Guangdong, the sexual stage of the fungus is rarely produced and plays an insignificant role in the disease cycle. The disease thrives in both warm, humid conditions and dry, hot weather. Comprehensive resistance investigations among varieties are still lacking. Currently, only the Phoenix pumpkin bred in Taiwan is known for its strong resistance. Other varieties such as the Jintop pumpkin from Jiangxi’s Jinggangshan, the Dourin kabocha and kabocha from Inner Mongolia, the May early pumpkin from Hubei's Xianning, the Goose-neck pumpkin from Hebei, the Box pumpkin from Jiangsu, and the Papaya pumpkin introduced in Taiwan have shown strong resilience or resistance, but further local observations and verifications are needed.",

        "answer": "Select resistant varieties which are commonly planted such as the Japanese Yixiang pumpkin, Jinchestnut pumpkin, and Orange pumpkin, and ensure pure and vigorous propagation with disease-free seedlings. For seed disinfection, sun-dry seeds for 1–2 days before planting to eliminate surface microbes and enhance germination. Soak seeds in 50°C–55°C water for 30 minutes, then continue soaking for 8–10 hours as the temperature decreases to 30°C, followed by disinfection in 1% potassium permanganate solution for 20–30 minutes. Rinse, then germinate for 48–72 hours at 28°C–30°C until sprouting occurs before planting. Manage fertilization wisely, ideally rotating with grass crops every 2–3 years. Apply 5000–7000 kg of mature farm manure per hectare, 20 kg of triple compound fertilizer, 15 kg of potassium chloride, and 5 kg of urea per hectare. Avoid fertilizing during the vine-stretching phase, and apply potassium sulfate compound fertilizer during fruit swelling, maintaining soil moisture and draining fields after rain promptly. Remove diseased, old, and yellow leaves from the base, burying them deeply or incinerating them. Improve field ventilation and light penetration to enhance plant resistance. Spray protective coatings before or at the early stage of infection using 99.1% dichlorvos at 300–500 times dilution on leaves, forming a protective layer and repeating every 5–7 days for 2–3 sessions. For chemical control, apply appropriate fungicides such as 53.8% Kasugamycin 1000 times dilution before disease onset, 10% Shigao 1500 times dilution, 40% Fuxing 8000 times dilution, 43% Pulike 5000 times dilution, 12.5% Suprotect 2000 times dilution, or 2% Kasugamine 600 times dilution by spraying every 7–10 days for 2–4 sessions. Alternatively, use a bicarbonate solution at 600 times dilution starting when 1–2 lesions appear on individual leaves, spraying every 3–4 days for 4–6 sessions. Bicarbonate not only controls diseases but also promotes growth and can increase pumpkin yield by 10–20%. When spraying, use fine nozzles to reduce leaf surface moisture.",

        "answer": "Grape leaf blight often appears suddenly over large areas. The visual symptoms resemble those of white rot disease, with initial water-soaked dark green blight at the leaf edges. Within a day, the affected areas turn yellow-brown, with another ring of dark green blight spreading inward. This rapid spread occurs even without rain or irrigation, causing severe blight of the entire leaf. Some growers mistake this disease for white rot disease, leading to ineffective control measures. To distinguish between the two, note that white rot disease starts at a single point on the leaf tip or edge, forming large, near-circular spots with indistinct concentric rings. In contrast, leaf blight spreads from the leaf edge towards the center, affecting the entire plant. Leaves exposed to more sunlight are more severely affected, especially at the intersections of trellises facing north. Vineyards with poor soil physical and chemical properties are more prone to severe outbreaks.",

Infected seedlings develop grayish-white patches on leaves and young stems, which can cause wilting, curling, browning, and death. Severely infected leaves develop dense black spots later. Infected mature trees have shriveled buds that sprout late with short internodes, narrow and stiff leaves with curled edges, and white powder covering new shoots. Infected flower buds produce deformed flowers with narrow petals and stunted growth. Infected young fruits develop white powdery spots that turn into rust spots.
